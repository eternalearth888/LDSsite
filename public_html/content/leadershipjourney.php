<h2>The Leadership Journey</h2>
<p>
Simply put, companies that thrive and prosper do so because of strong leaders. 
They are the difference-makers. Captain Mike Abrashoff is that kind of leader. Under
his direction, USS Benfold, an underperforming Naval War Ship, became the best 
ship in the Pacific Fleet within 12 months. Through Capt. Mike’s experience, 
principles and practices—contained in his bestselling business book, It’s Your Ship—
The Leadership Journey <a href="http://www.glsworld.com" target="_blank">GLSWorld.com</a> was born. 
</p>
<p>
Dr. Elia partners with GLS Worldwide in facilitating The Leadership Journey, 
providing company leaders with the information, skills and tools needed to 
reimagine their leadership and inspire their people to drive results. The Leadership 
Journey includes reality-based problem solving, accountability trios, TalMetrics, a 
360 survey and personal executive coaching every step of the way. In the end, 
participants will leave with a clear, actionable roadmap and a return-and-report 
accountability system to ensure successful results.

Company leaders and managers can also expect to know how to coach their own 
teams on a leadership journey, helping boost employee retention and productivity. 
According to Capt. Mike, he attributes part of his leadership success to the fact that 
he “recruited” his crew every day. He won over their hearts and their minds, and, 
thereby, increased their productivity. 
</p>
<p>
According to a recent Gallup poll on employee engagement, the business 
community is facing a significant and costly challenge in employee morale, 
productivity and turnover. The Leadership Journey gives leaders the skills and tools 
needed to excite, engage and retain a qualified, unified and productive workforce.
