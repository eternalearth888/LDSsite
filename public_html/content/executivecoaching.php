<h2>Executive Coaching</h2>
<p>
LDS Executive Coaching is in the business of taking organizational teams to the next
level.
Dr. Elia’s philosophy is straight forward: everyone has influence. Once organizations
recognize this and begin to tap the potential of each employee, that organization 
will witness major leaps in productivity. 
Collaborative, connected, open communication, along with empowerment and 
accountability, <i>will</i> lead to a happier and more productive workforce. People do not 
do their best work in silos, but they do succeed when they can connect with others, 
when they know they’re not in this alone, and when they know they’re being heard. 
In short, when technically brilliant executives can pair their expertise with the 
support of improved people skills, their bottom line always increases.
Dr. Elia knows how to get you where you need to be, and it doesn’t need to take 
years and years. In fact, within 6-12 months, you can expect to see significant 
change within your company, team, division or organization.
