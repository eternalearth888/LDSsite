<h2>Testimonials</h2>

“As CIO of a $3.8 billion company, I brought Dr. Gourgouris on board to assist us in 
our leadership transformation journey. What I learned along the way was that true 
success cannot be measured in merely dollars and cents or tasks accomplished, it 
must also be measured in the intangible ability to truly lead and inspire people to 
accomplish the mission or objectives of the organization and its leadership. To 
accomplish this, leadership must be applied at every level of an organization, 
people must be trained, educated, coached and mentored to perform at their peak 
level of collaboration and contribution. Very rarely do the stars align and this level of
synergy occur on its own.
</p>
<p>
In my experience of over 20 years of senior leadership with Fortune 500 companies,
I have met only a few select individuals who possessed the insight and skill sets to 
provide the leadership to achieve this level of transformation. <b>Dr. Gourgouris is 
one of those individuals.</b> He brings equal parts of coach, mentor and educator, 
serving as an organizational Sherpa to guide your team to new levels of 
collaboration and success. With his even-handed demeanor and deep interpersonal 
skill sets, I have seen him transform people and organizations that were deemed 
unsalvageable. Navigating the complexities of organizational politics and 
interpersonal issues, Dr. Gourgouris demonstrated time and time again his skill set 
and experience in creating high performance organizations and cultures. I would 
welcome the opportunity to partner with him again in any of my leadership and 
organizational development endeavors. He is the consummate professional.”

He is extremely knowledgeable, intuitive, and experienced - with over 25,000 hours of counseling and coaching clients which have come mostly through personal referrals. There is no greater proof of customer satisfaction than that!
