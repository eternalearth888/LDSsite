<h2>Focus Your Vision</h2>
<p>
Dr. Elia is also a certified trainer of the Focus Your Vision program, developed by inspirational keynote speaker, philosopher and photographer, Dewitt Jones.  This program guides individuals or entire teams through a reflective process to identify their purpose and connect with their vision, using passion to turn their vision into reality.
</p>
<p>
Focus Your Vision combines—on film—stories from Dewitt Jones’ unique life as a <i>National Geographic</i> photographer with his extraordinary photographs and insightful philosophy, to teach both creativity and vision. He turns everyday occurrences into extraordinary visions.
</p>
<p>
As a trainer, Dr. Elia steers people through a multisensory, self-discovery process that allows for creation of a clear, focused vision as well as finding the passion for your vision.
</p>
<p>
Passion is the energy and power that allows us to manifest our vision and drive our technique. Life demands that we have passion; it takes our visions from good to great to truly extraordinary.  
</p>
<p>
Dr. Elia covers seven key Focus Your Vision concepts:
<ol>
<li>Keep your vision focused</li>
<li>Stop, look, and listen</li>
<li>Hold onto the best, let the rest fall away</li>
<li>Trust your intuition</li>
<li>It’s not trespassing to go beyond your own boundaries</li>
<li>Make your vision big enough</li>
<li>Do you have juice in your camera?</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
“One of the most significant lessons I have learned in my life,” says Dewitt Jones, “is the importance of having a focused vision. Those visions keep me going and help me determine if I’m on the right track. When we take risks and believe in ourselves, we can turn our visions into reality and live that reality with passion; we can live into our dreams.”
