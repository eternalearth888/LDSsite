“Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” - Abraham 
Lincoln

<p>
These are true words from President Lincoln, a man who faced his share of 
adversity. Yet he managed to find ways to keep a positive outlook, a jovial spirit, and
he accomplished amazing feats for which we are forever grateful.
But how? And can we go and do likewise?
In our world that is often stressful, challenging and demanding, happiness seems to 
be elusive, and living life in a survival mode has become, sadly, the norm for many 
people.

happiness. It is our goal to help individuals acquire the tools necessary to achieve 
the happiness they desire.
