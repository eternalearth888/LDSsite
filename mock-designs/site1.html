				<h1>"In the end, it's all about relationships"</h1>
				<h2>Dr. Elias Gourgouris</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Whether working with C-level executives, direct reports, colleagues, vendors or customers, challenges at the workplace often come down to Relationships – how people do, or don’t, work well together. In fact, the more technologically advanced the world becomes, the more critical human interaction becomes.

				Dr. Elia Gourgouris recognizes the importance of relationships and how they affect organizations – from productivity to teamwork, collaboration, communication, conflict resolution, employee retention and more.  Through a multi-step process, he leads executives and employees on a journey of Leadership Development, personal accountability, goal setting, empowerment, and transparency…taking teams to the next level while building a firm foundation of trust.</p>
