Whether working with C-level executives, direct reports, colleagues, vendors or 
customers, challenges at the workplace often come down to <i>Relationships</i> – how 
people do, or don’t, work well together. In fact, the more technologically advanced 
the world becomes, the more critical human interaction becomes.
Dr. Elia Gourgouris recognizes the importance of relationships and how they affect 
organizations – from productivity to teamwork, collaboration, communication, 
conflict resolution, employee retention and more.

leads executives and employees on a journey of Leadership Development,
