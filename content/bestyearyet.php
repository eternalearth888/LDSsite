<h2>Best Year Yet!</h2>
<h3>Ready to have your best year ever? And then repeat it each and <i>every</i> year? </h3>
<p>
As a certified trainer in the principles of the “Best Year Yet” program, Dr. Elia guides executives and leaders through an interactive, self-reflective workshop where participants set transformational goals based on ten simple questions. Within a relatively short time, participants develop a one-page, annual plan for success to be carried out over the next 12 months—resulting in the best year of their life, both personally and professionally.
</p>
<p>
More than just goal setting, the Best Year Yet involves personal transformation by setting and achieving the goals that matter most. In going through this program, you can expect to improve your life and your business by:
<ul>
<li>Deciding what’s most important for your success</li>
<li>Setting transformational goals</li>
<li>Making big things happen in the coming year</li>
<li>Living your values to have the life you want</li>
<li>Delivering a breakthrough in one area of your life</li>
<li>Producing the results that matter most</li>
</ul>
With the Best Year Yet, leaders walk away with a precise, step-by-step road map of goal planning and goal management taking them through the next year.
